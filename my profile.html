    <p>1. School Counseling
        School counselors help students solve social and academic problems. Counselors at the high school level also prepare students for college or careers. They may help schools develop best practices to meet students' social and educational needs.
        
        Degree-seekers complete specialized classes in psychology. They explore counseling methods and child and adolescent development. Learners also gain skills to communicate effectively with students and their families.
        
        Most graduates pursue careers as school counselors. These positions typically require a master's degree and state licensure.</p>
        <h2> <strong> 2.Education Ledership</strong></h2>
        <p>Educational leadership focuses on the administrative side of education. Enrollees learn how to manage schools and other education organizations. Classes cover topics like educational law and policy, strategic planning, and curriculum development. Educational leadership programs may also emphasize business approaches to education. Degree-seekers may learn about school budgeting and finance.

            Compared to other education majors, educational leadership focuses less on classroom teaching and instructional strategies. Enrollees gain broader administrative and managerial skills to oversee K-12 school operations.
            
            Educational leadership programs commonly prepare candidates for jobs as school principals. Graduates may also pursue careers with school districts and other education organizations.</p>
         <h2><strong> 3.special Education</strong></h2>
         <p>Special education focuses on meeting the needs of students with developmental disabilities. Special educators often work with students experiencing mental, physical, and emotional issues that affect their learning.

            A special education degree focuses on teaching strategies and methods for special needs students. Degree-seekers explore different types of learning disabilities and appropriate teaching methods to meet varied needs.
            
            Special education graduates often work as K-12 special education teachers. Advanced education can help them move into administrative careers, developing broader special education policies for schools and school districts.</p>

    <h2 id="detail"> <strong>project details</strong></h2>
    <p>At the same time as the multinational talks were occurring, Dassault-Breguet had been busy designing its Avion de Combat Experimental (ACX). During late 1978, prior to France's joining of the ECA, Dassault received contracts for the development of project ACT 92 (Avion de Combat Tactique, meaning "Tactical Combat Airplane"). The following year, the National Office for Aviation Studies and Research began studying the possible configurations of the new fighter under the codename Rapace ("Bird of Prey"). By March 1980, the number of configurations had been narrowed down to four, two of which had a combination of canards, delta wings and a single vertical tail-fin.[9] The ACX project was given political impetus when the French government awarded a contract for two (later reduced to one) technology demonstrator aircraft on 13 April 1983. The government and industry would each provide half of the development cost, with first flight to take place in 1986.[17] At the time, there was no guarantee that the effort would result in a full-scale development programme, and the aircraft remained a purely "proof-of concept" test vehicle. In an effort to harmonize design specifics with the requirements of other countries while collaboration talks were being held, Dassault sized the ACX aircraft in the 9.5 tonne range. After France decided to pull out of the multilateral talks, designers focused on a more compact size, as specified by the Air Force.[18] The ACX programmed was renamed Rafale ("squall") in April 1985.[19]


        The Dassault Rafale A technology demonstrator
        Construction of the Rafale A (ACX) technology demonstrator started in 1984. It had a length of 15.8 m (52 ft), a wingspan of 11 m (36 ft), and a 9.5 t (21,000 lb) empty weight. The austere aircraft lacked in major subsystems, and had the minimal cockpit systems and a fly-by-wire flight control system for the validation of the design's basic airframe-engine layout. The company desired to use the Rafale A to continue the company approach of risk reduction through incremental improvement and to test the aerodynamically unstable delta wing-canard configuration.[20] The aircraft was Dassault's 92nd prototype in 40 years.[21] At the time of its construction, the aircraft had two 68.8 kN (15,500 lbf) General Electric F404 engines that were then in service with the F/A-18 Hornet, pending the availability of the Snecma M88 turbofan engines.[22][23] It was rolled out in December 1985 at Saint-Cloud, and on 4 July 1986, made its first flight from the company's Istres test facility in southern France, piloted by Guy Mitaux-Maurouard. During the one-hour flight, the aircraft reached an altitude of 11,000 m (36,000 ft) and a speed of Mach 1.3.[24] The aircraft participated in the Farnborough air show the following month.
        
        The aircraft participated in an intensive flight test programme that saw it simulate air force and naval operations. The test vehicle flew approaches to the carrier Clemenceau, and also tested for coordination with Foch. By 1987, the aircraft had been flown by Air Force, Navy and CEV test pilots. Its port-side F404 engine was replaced with the 72.9 kN (16,400 lbf) M88 in early 1990,[22] and the aircraft flew under the updated powerplant configuration in May 1990.[5][25] The aircraft thereafter attained a speed of Mach 1.4 without the use of engine reheat, thereby demonstrating supercruise.[26] The Rafale A was used until January 1994, and was retired after 867 sorties.[27]
        
        The early successful demonstration programme increased French industry and government confidence in the viability of a full-scale development programme for the Rafale. In June 1987, French prime minister Jacques Chirac declared that the government would proceed with the project. A contract for four pre-production aircraft (one Rafale C, two Rafale Ms and one Rafale B) was awarded on 21 April 1988 for a test and validation programme.[28][25] There was nevertheless government uncertainty in the programme, as it was expected to cost some Ffr120 billion (1988 francs) in total development and procurement costs.[29][30] Prime minister Michel Rocard was concerned about the state of the project and the failure of the previous government to secure cooperation with other countries, but stated that, "It is inconceivable that we should not be able to build the weapons necessary for our independence".[31] France had earlier entered unsuccessful talks with Belgium, Denmark, the Netherlands, and Norway, about the possible collaboration on the project.[32]
